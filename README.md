# mern-stack
Another boilerplate code for getting started with MERN stack using Webpack

## Introduction
This is an example generic code to help you (and me) to get started with the MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS and NodeJS) stack. It will include other usefull technologies that will also be useful on the development process.

## 1 - SetUP the npm + webpack bundler configs: 

### 1.1 - Creating package.json
*package.json* is the npm config file, it handles a bunch of metadata that will dictate how it's behaviour as well as dependencies and scripts execution.

### 1.2 - Creating webpack.config.js
*webpack.config.js* is the Webpack config file, it exports the configuration object on module.exports

### 1.3 - Executing
On this step you should be able to run the project executing:
```
  git clone https://github.com/ateixeira/mern-stack.git
  cd mern-stack
  npm install
  npm install -g webpack
  npm install -g webpack-dev-server
  npm run build 
  npm start
```
